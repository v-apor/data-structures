1: 16/06/2020:  How data is stored in a computer, CPU <> RAM <> Storage
		+ What are data structures? 
		+ What operations can be done? : Insertion, Deletion, Traversal (access each once), searching, sorting, access/lookup

2: 17/06/2020:  Static array (datatype[]) and Dynamic array (ArrayList in java). Dynamic array allows resizing.
	        + checked out all functions of arraylist
		+ Implementation of Dynamic Array in java using primitive static array.

3: 19/06/2020: HashTable in java Collection Intro

4: 27/06/2020: Linked List implementation + Java Linked List collection 

5: 28/06/2020:  Stack: java collection
		Queue: Java Interface (LinkedList implementation) I need to know more about interfaces and classes!!

6: 29/06/2020: Binary Search Tree: implementation (insert and lookup) (remove implementation left) 
	       + Self balancing BST theory : 
		1) AVL tree (Balance on every insertion such that difference between left subtree and right subtree (modulo) is <=1
		   4 cases: (left-left (right rotate); right-right (left rotate); left-right (left-right rotate); right-left) last two are complex
		2) Red-Black Tree: every node has color red or black and on every insertion we rebalance, there are 6 rules!!!! Man it's complex;
				
7: 30/06/2020: BitSets in java + TreeSet in java

8: 01/07/2020: TreeMap in java 
	       + Heaps DS, Priority Queue in java (PQs are build on top of Heaps) 

9: 03/07/2020: Graphs + Undirected Graph implementation java

10: 18/04/2021: + DS and Algo made easy
                + Abstract Data Type
